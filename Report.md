technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them:

I encoutered a few technical problems during the installation of the software development enviroment. The main issue being that my terminal could not find Gradle. I tried changing the path to the .exe file in "enviormental variables" aswell as I tried reinstalling Gradle. I did not manage to solve it so I had to use the absolute path to run gradle init and similar commands.
