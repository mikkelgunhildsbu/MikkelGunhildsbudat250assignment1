technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them:

I encoutered a few technical problems during the installation of the software development enviroment. The main issue being that my terminal could not find Gradle. I tried changing the path to the .exe file in "enviormental variables" aswell as I tried reinstalling Gradle. I did not manage to solve it so I had to use the absolute path to run gradle init and similar commands. There was also some issues with installing docker, but that simply due to writing the wrong commands.

I checked/validated the software development by running commands like java -version, gradle -v etc. I also used all components while running the app and pushing to git which shows that all components are working. 

When it comes to technical problems I have had issues with IntellIJ giving me multiple errors in the code. However the app still works when I run it and the error messages, and the error messages go away when I restart IntelliJ.
